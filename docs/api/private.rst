Private API
===========

The documentation for the private API is automatically generated by `sphinx-apidoc` and is only to be used for debug and development purposes.  None of the features documented here are intended for the end user.  Only features documented in the :ref:`public_api` are considered stable and suitable for use outside of PyRADS.
